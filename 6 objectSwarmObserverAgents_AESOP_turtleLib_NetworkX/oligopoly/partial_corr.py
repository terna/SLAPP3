"""
Partial Correlation in Python (clone of Matlab's partialcorr)

This uses the linear regression approach to compute the partial 
correlation (might be slow for a huge number of variables). The 
algorithm is detailed here:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_correlation#Using_linear_regression

Taking X and Y two variables of interest and Z the matrix with all the variable minus {X, Y},
the algorithm can be summarized as

    1) perform a normal linear least-squares regression with X as the target and Z as the predictor
    2) calculate the residuals in Step #1
    3) perform a normal linear least-squares regression with Y as the target and Z as the predictor
    4) calculate the residuals in Step #3
    5) calculate the correlation coefficient between the residuals from Steps #2 and #4; 

    The result is the partial correlation between X and Y while controlling for the effect of Z
